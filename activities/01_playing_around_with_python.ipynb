    "## Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment\n",
    "**Objective**: Install and configure a Jupyter Notebook environment on your computer or access one online (e.g., through Google Colab).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps**:\n",
    "1. **Install Anaconda**: Download and install Anaconda, a free distribution that includes Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and other essential packages for data science. Follow the installation instructions based on your operating system: [Anaconda Installation Guide](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).\n",
    "2. **Start Jupyter Notebook**: Open a terminal or command prompt, type `jupyter notebook`, and press Enter to start the Jupyter server. This will open a web browser displaying the Jupyter interface where you can create new notebooks. Alternatively, use online services like Google Colab that provide free access without local setup.\n",
    "3. **Create Your First Notebook**: In the Jupyter interface, click on “New” and then select “Python 3” to create a notebook for Python scripting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Running Your First Code\n",
    "**Objective**: Write and run your first piece of code in a Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps**:\n",
    "1. **Write Code**: In the first cell, type `print(\"Hello, World!\")` and click Run (or press ctrl + Shift + P for Windows, or visit [jupyter notebook.google.com](http://localhost)\n",

    "and run your first program with basic python script using Jupyter Notebook environment setup**: If you don't have Python code in a cell, write and run \"Hello, World!\"`. Then execute it by pressing shift+enter or the play button above. Run Hello, world! printed on screen after execution.\n",
    "3. **Run Code Cells** Once you can type more advanced python code snippets like `NumPy` arrays, data manipulation operations using pandas as well (such as plots and results are displayed inline with markdown cells\n",
    "# Basic Python Syntax Example: Simple Math Operations \n",
    "```python\n",
    "Learn basic math operation in a simple syntax and functions. For example, do this to run some arithmetic operations like adding two numbers or defining variables and running them through various mathematical calculations such as `a=2`+b=`3`) using standard python operators`. Run the cell by pressing shift+enter or clicking play button at top right corner of cell, which will display results directly inline within cells without needing another editor.\n",
    "# Markdown\n",
    "For adding formatted text and code, use # for headers in markdown cells to structure your notes better. For example, you can create a new cell below the previous code block, type \"# Header 1\", \"##Header2\" etc., to organize thoughts sectioning of your notebook with headings. Save changes using ctrl+s for saving or clicking save button on top menu bar).\n",

    "# Basic Error Handling in Python (Optional)\n",
    "For adding optional content and troubleshooting, here is some basic error handling syntax errors that can occur when coding: For example, try running incorrect code snippets like \"print(\"Hello World!\")\" should be corrected to `print`(\"Hello World!\")`. This will throw an error. Correct it by fixing the typo or changing quotation marks around the string`. Run the cell again and correct syntax in python scripts or terminal using proper indentation or parentheses (`print('Hello, World!')\n",
